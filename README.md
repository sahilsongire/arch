  ARCH LINUX
  
  INTRODUCTION:-
                
  Arch Linux ( is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a                 rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.

  PACKAGE MANAGER:-

  Pacman, a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, is used to install, remove and update software packages.

  AND IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT PACMAN SHOULD BE USED....
  YOU CAN USE FLATPAK ALSO.BY INSTALLING ITS REPO IN YOUR ARCH-BASED SYSTEM.

  THERE IS THIS POPULAR MEME FOR ARCH USERS:-
