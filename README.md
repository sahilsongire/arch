# Arch Linux

## Introduction

Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution. It follows a rolling-release model, aiming to provide the latest stable versions of most software. The default installation is a minimal base system, allowing users to configure and add only what is necessary.

## Package Manager

Pacman, a package manager specifically designed for Arch Linux, is used for installing, removing, and updating software packages.

However, it's not necessary to use Pacman exclusively. You can also use Flatpak by installing its repository on your Arch-based system.

## Arch Users Humor

There's a popular meme in the Arch community:

But jokes aside...

Arch users are known for their advanced skills and experience in the open-source community. Using Linux or Arch is considered a sign of having an insane amount of expertise.

If you were to ask me about my favorite Linux distribution, Arch would be at the top of the list. The way it works, the aesthetics after customization (or "ricing" in Reddit language) â€“ there's no greater joy.
